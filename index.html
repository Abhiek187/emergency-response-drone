					<h1>Proposal</h1>

					<h3>Problem Diagnosis</h3>
					<p>Despite the best efforts of firefighters and other first responders, nearly seven people die each day due to 
						fires. Every year fires on average destroy nearly $6.5 billion in property damages and cost 2500 people 
						their lives. First responders then must risk their lives in order to figure out whether the structure is 
						safe or not and to figure out where people are in the burning building in order to rescue them. Even with 
						the floorplans of the building, during the events of fires, fires can result in unexpected circumstances 
						such as collapsed structures, chemical spill, the possibility of explosions, or any other dangers. People 
						can also even be trapped in unexpected places. The All-Purpose Emergency Response Drone proposal will be 
						able to assist first responders in an effort to minimize the loss of life that occurs due to fires every 
						year.
					</p>
					<h3>Proposed Treatment</h3>
					<p>In order to reduce the loss of life that fires cause each year, our plan is to have a drone that first 
						responders will be able to interact with through a user interface. The drone will be able to fly into 
						burning buildings in an effort to find out where any survivors are trapped in the building. The drone 
						will be able to use an infrared camera to locate possible survivors. It will also be enabled with sensors 
						so it can detect obstacles in the building. The success of the device will be based on if it can detect 
						where the people are trapped in the building. The user will probably define the success to be the number 
						of people the device helped save as well. The business value of the define comes into effect with 
						firefighters. The way the drone will work is that firefighters will deploy the drone and will be able to 
						maneuver it using the remote controls. There will be a monitor for them to see what the drone is seeing. 
						The monitor will also pin out the location of survivors on the floor plans. This will guide the 
						firefighters in the process of detecting survivors and the dangers in the building. Utilizing the drone 
						will reduce the number of lives that are endangered as firefighters will no longer need to explore every 
						room in order to find people trapped in the building.
					</p>
					<h3>Plan of Work and Product Ownership</h3>
					<p>There are many steps involved in making sure the drone is completely ready for use in the field. The first 
						step is to obtain a drone. We are in the process of getting the drone, which will take a few days. One 
						basic component of the drone that needs to be altered would be the drone's maneuverability. Standard drones 
						are capable of flight. However, since the drone will be used in extreme situations, it would need to be 
						manipulated so it can move around and even dodge certain obstacles. This could be done with the addition 
						of a few motors and sensors along with some changes to the code. The code for the project will be in Java. 
						The motor and sensor components can be completed separately. This shouldn't take that long maybe a week or 
						two. The camera component, which is using an infrared camera, is also rather simple. This is because the 
						raspberry pi is compatible with an infrared camera. This will probably take a week to do so unless there is 
						a lot of code that needs to be modified. The part that will probably take a while to figure out a way to 
						store all the data the drone is getting from the burning building and analyze it. Depending on the scale 
						and the possible scenarios that could be considered, this could easily take a few weeks.
					</p>
					<p>Based on the type of work that will be involved in this project and the various skill sets of each group member, 
						there are just enough members in this group to accomplish our goals. Since a majority of the group is 
						proficient when it comes to programming, it is rather simple to divide up each component of the project 
						into sub-groups and be able to work on multiple aspects at the same time. Having fewer people would make 
						it rather tough to complete the project in an efficient manner, due to the amount of work involved. As 
						mentioned earlier the success of our device will be based on its ability to navigate through various 
						obstacles and locate possible survivors in emergency response situations.
